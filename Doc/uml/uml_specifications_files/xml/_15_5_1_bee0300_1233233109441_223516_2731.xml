This will create a dummy prolog program that will analyse, when run, if a variable is known at a specific location in the parsing.
If, in prolog logic, the variable is used while not yet known (not yet saved), then it is a postponed variable. This means that we want to use a variable that will be known later on during the parsing.
This is coherent because logol does not impose any left to right or right to left reading.</body><owner humanName="Owner" humanType="State" icon="uml_specifications_files/icon_1124046256.png" mode="standard,expert" name="Generate prolog" refid="_15_5_1_bee0300_1233232830785_865256_2703"/><owningElement humanName="Owning Element" humanType="State" icon="uml_specifications_files/icon_1124046256.png" name="Generate prolog" refid="_15_5_1_bee0300_1233232830785_865256_2703"/></comment></magicdraw>
